# Graduation-Project
This is a prototype nicknamed "Crionica" created for my graduation Thesis for the Computer Science about decision making in games.

Due to being a prototype, is very "rustic" but puts in action the main mechanic of branching dialogs and NPC interaction.

All sprites in the game were made by me, and i had a bit of help for the game logic from my friend Anderson Duarte (https://github.com/AndersonDuarte-png).

Attached to this repository i leave my Thesis (in portuguese) for anyone who would like to give it a look.
